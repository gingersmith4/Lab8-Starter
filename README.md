How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 

Graceful degradation is the idea that you build your software with as much technology as you want to give it lots of features and functionality, and you prepare for what to do if a user doesn't have all of that technology. You're accepting that the full tech won't always work and making a plan so that your program will still be usable. Service workers help us respond gracefully when the wifi drops or the network stops working. This is because they use the cache to store previous information that can be reused if we don't have access to the network.
